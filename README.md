🥏 MKS Disc Golf Tracker: The Mendelsohn Protocol"I am the standard. They have to beat me; I will not beat myself."OverviewThis application is the digital enforcement of The Mendelsohn Protocol, a strategic mental framework designed for the Loriella Challenge. It replaces "feeling" with data and "deliberation" with execution.The app serves two functions:The Caddie: Displays the specific, pre-determined game plan for every hole (Shorts & Longs).The Analyst: Logs actual performance data (Disc selection, Shot shape, Rating) to refine the bag for Tournament Day.Core AxiomsBoring Golf: A stroke saved by safety is worth more than a stroke gained by brilliance.Tee Box Discipline: All thinking happens behind the box. Inside the box is for execution only.The 10-Second Rule: Emotional processing is allowed for exactly 10 seconds. Then, it is evicted.Tech StackFrontend: Streamlit (Python)Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)Auth: Supabase AuthAnalysis: PandasSetup & Installation1.
